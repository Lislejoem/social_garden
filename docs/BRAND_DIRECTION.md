---

## Visual Design System

### Core Aesthetic
**Glassmorphism + Soft Gradients** - Frosted glass components floating over gradient backgrounds

### Color Palette

| Element | Direction |
|---------|-----------|
| **Background** | Soft gradient (green core with warm peach/coral accents) |
| **Primary** | Emerald family (keep existing) |
| **Health colors** | Thriving (emerald) → Growing (light emerald) → Thirsty (lime) → Parched (orange) |
| **Warm accents** | Soft peach/coral for emotional warmth |

### Typography

| Usage | Font | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Headers** | Cormorant Garamond | Elegant, sophisticated wellness vibe. Use at 24px+ only. |
| **Body** | Karla | Humanist sans-serif, excellent screen readability |

**Migration:** Playfair Display (current) → Cormorant Garamond

### Animation & Interaction

| Element | Style |
|---------|-------|
| **Motion** | Subtle & smooth with delightful micro-interactions |
| **Tactile** | Soft press (cushion-like scale-down on tap, ~0.97-0.98 scale) |
| **Transitions** | Gentle easing, no abrupt changes |

### Components

- **Cards:** Glassmorphic effect (blur, translucency, subtle border)
- **Buttons:** Soft press feedback, cushion feel
- **Backgrounds:** Gradient (green core, warm accents)

## Brand Voice

### Tone
**Warm & encouraging** - supportive, never guilt-inducing

### Metaphor Approach
**Subtle references** - Use garden language strategically:
- Health statuses (thriving, growing, thirsty, parched) ✓
- Key moments (empty states, celebrations) ✓
- Let functional language be functional elsewhere

### Do
- "Your Grove is flourishing"
- "Sarah is thriving"
- "Time to tend your garden"

### Don't
- Force garden words into every action
- Use metaphor where clarity matters more
- Make users decode what actions mean

---

## Name Decision

### Final Choice: **Grove**

### Rationale
- **Memorability:** 1 syllable, familiar word, easy to recommend
- **Metaphor alignment:** Trees in a grove = relationships in a network
- **Psychological frame:** Community, belonging, active nurturing
- **Copy flexibility:** "Your Grove is flourishing" works naturally
- **Advisor consensus:** Unanimous recommendation from 7-advisor panel

### Domain Strategy
Primary targets (in order of preference):
1. getgrove.com
2. groveapp.com
3. trygrove.com
4. usegrove.com

### Grove Collaborative Risk Mitigation
- Different category (eco-products vs personal CRM)
- Target "personal CRM" keywords rather than brand name alone
- Clear App Store positioning: "Grove - nurture your relationships"

---

## Implementation Notes

### Mobile UX Considerations (from advisor panel)
1. **Glassmorphism performance:** Limit to 2-3 blurred elements visible at once
2. **Typography:** Cormorant Garamond for headers only, never body text
3. **Contrast:** Test gradient backgrounds with WCAG tools
4. **Press states:** Ensure visibility, not just feel (accessibility)

### Resource Estimate
- Glassmorphism adds ~20-30% to frontend development time
- Worth it for differentiation in crowded market
