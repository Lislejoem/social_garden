UI/UX Brainstorming: The Social Garden

To maintain the "Digital Garden" vibe, the UI should feel organic, calm, and high-quality. Avoid "Admin Dashboard" vibes (no heavy borders, no bright red alerts).

1. The "Garden" Dashboard (Home)

Visuals: Instead of a rigid table, use a Fluid Grid of cards.

The "Bloom" State:

Contacts you've spoken to recently have a soft green glow or a small "sprout" icon (Thriving/Growing).

Contacts that are "wilting" have slightly desaturated colors or a specific "thirsty" icon (Thirsty/Parched).

Typography: Use a sophisticated serif for headings (like Playfair Display) and a clean, legible sans-serif for notes.

2. The "Contact Greenhouse" (Profile View)

The Cheat Sheet: A "pinned" section at the top with 3-5 bullet points.

Example: "Likes Dry January," "Allergic to Peanuts," "Kids: Leo (6), Sarah (4)."

Interaction Timeline: A vertical timeline that focuses on AI-generated summaries of past interactions rather than raw logs.

Seedling Bed: A dedicated side panel for "Things to follow up on," keeping future ideas separate from historical facts.

3. The "Brain Dump" UI (Input)

Mobile First: A large, central "Plus" button or Microphone icon on the mobile view that opens a minimalist text/recording area.

Recording Waveform: If using voice-to-note, show a soft, pulsing wave rather than a standard "recording" bar.

AI Feedback: When the AI finishes processing a note, show a small "Gardener's Report" summarizing what was updated in the garden.

4. Semantic Search Bar

Natural Language Focus: The placeholder text should be a prompt, e.g., "Ask your garden: Who lives in Chicago?" or "Search: Gift ideas for Sarah..."

Instant Previews: As you type, show small "profile snippets" that highlight why that person matches the search.

5. The Morning Digest (The "Daily Watering")

Layout: A single, scrollable "Card" delivered as the first thing you see in the morning.

Content Blocks:

Upcoming Birthdays: (Next 7 days).

Nudges: "It's been a while since you watered your friendship with [Name]."

Follow-ups: "Last time you spoke to [Name], they mentioned [Seedling]. Want to check in?"
